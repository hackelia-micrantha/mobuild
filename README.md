# 📱 mobuild

**mobuild** is a modular mobile build platform designed to enhance app security, streamline CI/CD workflows, and lay the foundation for intelligent, self-healing software. It provides a public-facing SDK skeleton while integrating powerful private components for runtime protection and build-time obfuscation.

---

## 🚀 Overview

mobuild is built to support mobile developers with:

- A **public SDK skeleton** that gets dynamically updated during CI/CD
- **Private security modules** for runtime protection and build-time obfuscation
- A forward-looking roadmap toward **observability** and **AI-driven self healing**

---

## 🧩 Architecture

### 🔓 Public Components

- **SDK Skeleton**  
  A lightweight, extensible interface that gets populated with build-time logic via CI/CD.  
  - Provides hooks for private modules  
  - Safe for open-source distribution  
  - Updated automatically during builds
  - supports multiple mobile architectures

### 🔐 Private Subprojects

These are integrated as private submodules and injected at build time:

#### `envuscator`  
Adds a dynamic security layer by **randomly obfuscating environment variables** during build.  
- Prevents predictable access patterns  
- Ensures runtime variables are protected from static analysis

#### `warden`  
Performs **low-level device integrity checks** to detect rooted or jailbroken environments.  
- Blocks execution on compromised devices  
- Integrates with native OS-level APIs for deep inspection

---

## ⚙️ CI/CD Integration

mobuild is designed to work seamlessly with modern CI/CD pipelines:

- Injects private modules during build
- Updates SDK skeleton with latest logic
- Supports environment-specific configurations
- Keeps public repo clean and secure

---

## 🧠 Future Roadmap

We're building toward a smarter, more autonomous platform:

### 🔭 Observability
- Real-time build metrics
- Runtime diagnostics
- Security event logging

### 🤖 AI Self-Healing
- Automatically creates issues and pull requests
- Reviews and merges security patches
- Generates new releases based on telemetry and threat detection

## 📦 Getting Started

> Note: This repo contains only the public SDK skeleton. Private modules are injected during CI/CD and are not accessible here.

```bash
# Clone the public repo
git clone https://github.com/your-org/mobuild.git

# Initialize submodules (if you have access)
git submodule update --init --recursive
